    "- Beginning Of The Year\n",
    "At the beginning of the year, I’ll be honest — I wasn’t very good at computer science. Everything felt confusing, from writing simple code to setting up my projects. One of the first things I did was create a virtual environment, which at the time felt like a huge step. I didn’t totally understand what it did, but it helped me get started and gave me a place to experiment safely without breaking anything else on my computer. Also my focus wasnt the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Middle of the Year\n",
    "As the year went on, I started learning more and even helped teach small classes about JavaScript. Teaching others turned out to be one of the best ways to learn myself. I got to see how other people thought about coding problems, and I learned a lot from my classmates too. My focus at this time of the year had gotten better but I was still very easily distracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Changing Games and Learning how CSS\n",
    "One of the biggest turning points for me was when we started modifying games. Changing little parts of the games helped me understand how CSS worked, especially with visual effects like borders and animations. I remember discovering commands like borderGlow, which made elements on the screen light up in cool ways. That was when coding really started to feel creative and fun, not just technical. As more assignments started piling up my focus started improving and I wasnt as easily distracted anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "- End of the Year\n",
    "By the end of the year, I had made my final game project. It was the most challenging and rewarding thing I’d done all year. I learned how to work with different game engines and how to use basic pixel art to make my designs come alive. Looking back, I’m proud of how far I’ve come — from struggling to set up a virtual environment to creating my own interactive game. This class taught me not just about coding, but also about learning, teamwork, and creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-N@M\n",
    "Finnaly As our finally we had the N@M it was a day when we prensented our games to other students parents and any other visitors. We got many comments on how our game was nice some of them included that the background and the character was nice. One of our feedbacks included that we should slow the game down more at the start and make it faster gradually instead of making it fast at the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What I Learned\n",
    "How to read and modify an existing game engine’s codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "How object-oriented programming (inheritance, encapsulation, classes) works in real projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to use GitHub Issues and Kanbans to coordinate tasks as a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to debug complex interactions and optimize performance under pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to present and document my work clearly for both technical and non-technical audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint 3 was by far the hardest and most rewarding sprint. We learned how to for the first time acctually code a game. Wehad to learn how to make a scrolling background vertically as we were only provided with a horizontally scrolling background\n",
    "\n",
    "- Challenges faced Faced\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCS Engine Limitations: The engine wasn’t designed for heavy projectile systems or fast combat, so we had to dig through the source code to understand how to extend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Issues: The character was too small and the speec was too fast\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision Bugs: At the start the player would just go through the roadblocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Collaboration: Merging code from multiple branches caused frequent conflicts, especially when editing core files.\n",
    "\n"
