    "    Step 1: Creating the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we could dive into the game itself, our teacher showed us how to set up a virtual environment. We used the code (source venv/bin/activate) to activate it. We used a series of commands to set it up.\n",

    "Here’s what I learned :\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is like a clean space where you can install the tools and libraries you need just for one project.\n",

    "    Step 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We also learned how to change the theme of our repository(pages)\n",
